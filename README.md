# WaterRacerGameüèÅ
Welcome to Water Racer! This game mimicks a carnival game in which an array of players are equipped with water-ejecting implements and a corresponding target. Each player then races to hit their target which awards to them some form of progress. The game is won by being the first player whose progress reaches a specified goal.

In our virtual analogy, the water-ejector activator for each player corresponds with a key on the keyboard. The major difference in our starter code is that, rather than depending on the accuracy of the player's aim for points, progress is awarded proportional to the rate at which the player's key is pressed. That is, the player who presses their key at the most rapid rate will win.
